# Voyage To Eternity

This project is part of a college assignment for *Game Technologies 4* at *FHICT*.

***Voyage To Eternity*** is a turn-based strategy game, with gameplay based on [Fire Emblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem) and other similair games.

The goal is to create a prototype of this concept with (hopefully) the following features:
* Randomly generated maps.
* Turn-based system.
* A* Pathfinding.
* AI controlled opponent.
* Leveling system.
* Endless gameplay.
